### Side Effects , Async Task

Reducer function must be pure, side effect free and synchronous.When we dispatch some actions that would involve side effects like HTTP requests to be sent. Where should we put our code ?

There are two possible places
1.Inside the component (eg - useEffect()) So we dispatch action after sideEffect is done so Redux dont know anything about the side effect.

2. Action Creators
